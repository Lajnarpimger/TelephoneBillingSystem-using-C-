Telephone Billing System is a system which is primarily used to calculate the total bill of a user. The user provides their number and their bill amount is displayed to them. The basic functionalities of this system include adding a call record, searching all the call records of a particular user, displaying all the available call records, deleting the call records and so on. Using C++ programming language, it was possible to construct the workings of these functions. The data structure used is mostly doubly-linked list, which is seemed to have a high efficiency for searching and traversing operations. 
The provided sample call records in the main.cpp program can later be replaced by a real call, and this particular program will play an essential role in storing as well as searching from the data obtained in actual calls, which will be benefitial to execute functionalities in the data like calculating the total bill of a user, clearing the bill after it is paid and so on.
